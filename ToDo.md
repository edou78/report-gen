#ToDo List

# ToDo #

1) Improve the handling of comments. I have mocked up something rough
so that if someone enters "She" and the individual is male then it
will automatically change to "He". I reckon a better solution would be
to have a file with word pairs "He"->"She", "His"->"Her" etc.

2) Finish the PDF generation. I have started this but not done too much

3) Write a generalised front end so that an admin user can look at
comments from any member of staff (each member of staff can only see
comments from themselves.)

4) Finish the network socket functions so that CSVs can all be stored on a single machine!

5) Maybe write a frontend using GTK, so that it would integrate better
into Gnome.

6) I reckon for windows use, although GTK could be installed it may
just be easier to use TK as it is the standard built in to the Python
interpreter
