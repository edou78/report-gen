Example Usage:

A school needs to write reports for parents to see how their children are performing.

It needs to be simple and quick. Schools can provide staff with a CSV file containing name, form, gender etc.

reportGen takes this information and allows teachers to add comments. It also checks words such as "he" against gender and transforms to "she" if needed.

The software can then be used to produce reports

...or...

Admin staff can then use the other part of the software to read all of the teachers comments and produce the final reports, ready to be printed.
